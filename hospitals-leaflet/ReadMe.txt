Emergency Hospitals : 

ER Wards Availability and Hospital Route Description including Traffic.

Ever been in a situation when you had an Emergency and didn't know whether your nearest hospital would have a ER Ward available or not!?
Well, we have solved that problem for you.

Our project's visualization has been created out of a dataset for all the Hospitals in a particular city in US (can be expanded for more cities)
The dataset consists of various attributes like Name,City,County,Address,Phone,ER Beds,Total Beds,ICU,Average Cost etc.

The visualisation offers filters based on ER Beds Available and Cost for a range of values. 
Also, you can select an area to have a quick look for hospitals in the same.

Primarily, you can select your location by clicking anywhere on the map and we'll calculate and display the nearest possible Hospitals 
having ER Wards available and the route to those hospitals with Distance and Time required to reach there using HERE Routing API.

Future Scope :
Train a ML model to predict real time availability of ER Beds for Hospitals based on historic data (ER Beds occupancy over a period of time)

In addition to showing the route's distance and time, we can show the exact navigable path a person has to follow to reach the 
nearest Hospital with ER Beds available at that instance of time on the Map and highlight the area with Traffic.

Expand this to more cities in the world.
